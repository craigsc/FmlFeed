<p>FMLFeed is the go-to website to see FMLs from around the world. FMLFeed filters through public Facebook statuses in order to find the very best FMLs for you to read. With a source of over 500 million people, there are always new FMLs being published to the feed. FMLFeed is still currently in Beta and new features will go live over the coming months so keep an eye on this space and the <a href="http://www.fmlfeed.tumblr.com">blog</a> for more details.<p>

<h3>So what is an FML?</h3>
<p>I'm happy you asked! FML stands for "f*** my life" and it is commonly used after describing a situation which... well... sucks. This phrase is usually used in more of a sarcastic and funny context so the stories associated with its use are usually incredibly entertaining to read.<p>
